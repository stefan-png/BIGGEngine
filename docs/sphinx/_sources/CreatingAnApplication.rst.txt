Creating An Application
=======================

To make an application, you need an instance of an implementation of ``ContextI``. You can implement one
yourself, or use the provided ``GLFWContext``.

After creating a context, you should set up all your callbacks. This is done using ``ContextI::subscribe``.

.. doxygenfunction:: BIGGEngine::ContextI::subscribe



voila! An aplications!!
